# Hi, I’m andreansx 

I'm a 16 year old self-taught Networking enthusiast and I am very interested in the underlying hardware that makes the Data center technologies possible. 

My primary focus and career goal is Data Center Network Engineering.

I spend most of my time in my Data center styled lab where I read a lot about the architecture of Network Operating Systems and switch chips.    

Currently I'm focused on two things.   

The first is learning about things like:   
* Broadcom StrataXGS ASICs architecture, about hardware-level reasons why some of those chips can while others cannot perform RIOT    
* switching engines architecture inside switch chips   
* TCAM memory    
* and EVPN-VXLAN on JunOS using vQFX and vSRX3    

I'm also planning out the implementation of L3 Clos architecture in my lab.   
I don't have it already done but after I pass CCNA, this will be my main focus.    

The second thing is studying for the CCNA exam.   
I am in fact not a fan of Cisco's IOS as I very much prefer Juniper's JunOS, but the CCNA is very widely respected so I am aiming to pass it in this year.
