# Hi, I’m andreansx 

I'm a 16 year old self-taught Networking and infrastructure enthusiast and I have a really deep passion for the technologies that power todays data centers like BGP EVPN, VXLANS, Ansible, JunOS and Dell EMC OS9/OS10.
My primary focus and career goal is Data Center Network Engineering.

I spend most of my time in my datacenter styled lab where I build and learn networking technologies.   

Currently Im focused on two things.   

First thing is practicaly learning my favourite technologies which are BGP EVPN, VXLANs, TCAM memory and my favourite systems which are **Dell EMC OS9** and **JunOS on vSRX3 and vQFX**.    
I am in the process of mapping out and planning the transition of my network to a Spine-Leaf L3-Only fabric since that's what I want to learn.    
Right now, I am in fact not implementing VXLANs or L3-Only fabric because that is actually a pretty advanced topic and I am now studying for one more thing mentioned below.    
After that, I will get fully into turning my lab into a more Datacenter-like network with **VXLANs, BGP EVPN** on **Dell OS9** and **vMX**.

And the second thing is studying for the CCNA which I would like to take soon.  
Even though I don't really like Cisco's IOS, I want to pass CCNA since it's actually pretty universal and very widely respected.
