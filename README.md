# Hi, I’m andreansx 

I'm a 16 year old self-taught Networking and infrastructure enthusiast and I have a really deep passion for the technologies that power todays data centers like BGP EVPN, VXLANS, Ansible and JunOS.
My primary focus and career goal is Data Center Network Engineering.

I spend most of my time in my datacenter styled lab where I build and learn networking technologies.   

Currently Im focused on two things.   

First thing is practicaly learning my favourite technologies like **BGP EVPN**, **VXLANs** etc. and modern L3-Only networks.   
I learn those technologies by implementing them on **Juniper JunOS on vSRX3** vRouter and on **Dell EMC OS9** on my **Dell EMC S4048-ON**.    
I'm also currently implementing distributed routing using **vSRX3 routers in my PVE server** and connecting everything with **eBGP** Sessions   

And the second thing is studying for the CCNA which I would like to take soon.  
Even though I don't like Cisco's IOS, I want to pass CCNA since it's actually pretty universal and widely respected.
